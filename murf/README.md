## Murf

`murf` is a **M**ocking and **U**nit test **F**ramework for **R**ust, that was inspired by the [gmock](http://google.github.io/googletest/gmock_cook_book.html) framework implemented by google.

`murf` is currently under development and has no official release. Nevertheless, we believe it is helpful for RUST developers. This is because we have intensively looked around the market for corresponding tools and found that tool support for RUST is still insufficient in this respect.
In the next months we would like to work - as far as our time allows - on the documentation of the tool and also refactor some things.

If the solution appeals to you we would of course be very happy about your contribution to the product.

If you want to know how to use `murf`, please have a look at the [unit tests directory](murf/tests/interface), there we have implemented several small tests for the current feature set of `murf`.

We appreciate any feedback on the solution. It helps us to improve the crate to allow an official release on crates.io (and of course a proper documentation with more examples).

We are looking forward to your feedback :)
